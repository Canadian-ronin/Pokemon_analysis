Welcome!

For this project, I am creating an up to date (up to date all the way to Pre-Pokemon: Arceus so its nearly accurate) Pokemon analysis project.

My goals for this particular project are to give you, the user to:
    1. Choose and learn the quantities of pokemon in a single type
    2. Display that data in an easy to compare format of a table
    3. Fetch the number of pokemon of single or multitype
    4. Create pokemon teams of up to six randomized pokemon from our database

Optionally, I would like to add links to the wiki pages if I finish things up early
