Hello there! Welcome to the world of Pokémon! My name is Eliza! I am not a Pokémon Professor, but I am a fan of the series!

This Jupyter notebook is designed to analyse the entirety of the Pokédex (Pre-Arceus)
For this project, I am creating an up to date (up to date all the way to Pre-Pokemon: Arceus so its nearly accurate) Pokemon analysis project.

My goals for this particular project are to give you, the user to:
    1. Choose and learn the quantities of pokemon in a single type
    2. Display that data in an easy to compare format of a pie chart
    4. Create pokemon teams of up to six randomized pokemon from our database


To run this project, you will need to have installed the following:
- Pandas
- Random
- matplotlib

To use this program, read through the very first initial markdown for a summary of what each cell will do, you will need to run the first cell in which you'll need to have installed the modules listed above. 

The three listed features are separated by their markdowns, so if you want to run one feature, you would need to run all the respective cells for that markdown as indicated in said markdown.
