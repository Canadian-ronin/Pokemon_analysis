#### Hello there! Welcome to the world of Pokémon! My name is Eliza! I am not a Pokémon Professor, but I am a fan of the series! This Jupyter notebook is designed to analyse the entirety of the Pokédex (Pre-Arceus)! For this project, I am creating a nearly Pokemon analysis!

Welcome to my Python project! This project has a few different options for you to run! Below are the current listed functions available to you! To use a feature, find the markdown that has the listed feature, and then, if necessary respond as prompted!

1. Tell you how many pokemon there are in a requested type
2. Display a pie chart of all the types in a visual format with percentages
3. Create ranodmized pokemon teams of up to six randomly chosen pokemon



To run this project, you will need to have installed the following:
- Pandas
- matplotlib

To use this program, read through the very first initial markdown for a summary of what each cell will do, you will need to run the first cell in which you'll need to have installed the modules listed above. 

The three listed features are separated by their markdowns, so if you want to run one feature, you would need to run all the respective cells for that markdown as indicated in said markdown.
