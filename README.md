Welcome!
For this project, I am creating an up to date (up to date all the way to Pre-Pokemon: Arceus so its nearly accurate) Pokemon analysis project.
My goals for this particular project are to give you, the user to:
1. Choose and learn the quantities of pokemon in a single type
2. Display that data in an easy to compare format of a table
3. Fetch the number of pokemon of single or multitype
4. Create pokemon teams of up to six randomized pokemon from our database
